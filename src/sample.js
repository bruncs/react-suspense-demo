        "<p><b>Suits</b> delves into the fast-paced, high-stakes world of a top Manhattan corporate law firm where hotshot associate Harvey Specter makes a risky move by hiring Mike Ross a brilliant but unmotivated college dropout, as his associate. As he becomes enmeshed in this unfamiliar world, Mike relies heavily on the firm's best paralegal Rachel Zane and Harvey's no-nonsense assistant Donna Paulsen to help him serve justice. With a photographic memory and the street smarts of a hustler, Mike proves to be a legal prodigy despite the absence of bonafide legal credentials.</p>",

      summary:
        "<p>The eighteenth-century French writer Nicolas Restif de la Bretonne recorded history, but so embroidered with his own imagination that the distinction between fact and fiction is often blurred. He was nicknamed 'The Owl', because it was his custom to walk the streets of Paris at night. <b>Les Nuits Révolutionnaires</b> (based on Les Nuits de Paris) spans the period 1789 - 1793 and, rather than giving a factual account of those years, Restif's writing brings to life the nocturnal world of the troubled city, as he observed it during the hours of darkness. He conjures up the other characters who also haunted the shadows - amongst them The Procuress, The Blind Man and The Lamplighter. Les Nuits Révolutionnaires immerses the viewer in Restif's strange existence, away from the loud mobs, in the troubled backwaters of the Revolution. To this turbulent arena is added the drama of his own life and the inspired wit of his fantasies. Les Nuits Révolutionnaires begins a few nights before the fall of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 and covers the King's execution and the start of the Reign of Terror, ending in June 1793, but the events of the Revolution form only a background to a dramatisation of Restif's fantastic stories.</p>",
